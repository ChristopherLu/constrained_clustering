INSTALLATION
	Download textclust.tar.gz and uncompress it into the desired directory.
	It will create a new directory textclust/ under your desired directory.
	Add the path to Matlab using: 'addpath desireddir/textclust -end' in
	Matlab command line.

USAGE
	Use 'help textclust' in Matlab to view available algorithms and use
	'help kberns', 'help kmns', etc. to view details of individual algorithms.
	Please view the references for further detials.
