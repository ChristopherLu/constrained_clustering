# Constrained Clustering 

This is a MATLAB code containing a set of clustering algorithms. 

Part of this code is used to simulate the experiments in [this](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06235) work.

BTW, there is a list of constrained clustering algorithms with available codes [here](http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~khashab2/files/2015_constrained_clustering/constrainedClustering.html).
